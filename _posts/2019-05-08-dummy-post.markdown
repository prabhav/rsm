## Client: ENAR Consultants 

This school building coming in Raipur is having Ground+3 floors above. The building plan is very unique having two oval shaped blocks at 60 degree angle overlapped each other. The length of the oval is 65 meter. Since two blocks are overlapping each other , expansion joint was not feasible. The Building has been analysed and designed in ETABS. The structure has been analysed and designed for thermal stresses also. Moment resistant RCC framed structure has been provided to take care of all the vertical and lateral loads. Raipur is in Zone-II as per IS:1893, so we are designing the building as non ductile structure and detailing has been done as per IS 456.
Total area of the building is about 1,60,000 sqft.
