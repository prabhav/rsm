- quote: |-
    We have had the good fortune to collaborate with RSM Engineering consultants for the last 20 years. They have played a massive part in bringing to reality all our designs in this period, including the Industrial project for Dr.Oetker India. Made completely in Precast pretension concrete, it is a testimony to the creativity and dexterity of M/s RSM Engineering consultants.
    Efficient analysis of structural models on software such as e-tabs ensures that each design is reliable and economical. Timely delivery is another highlight of RSMs workflow and we have always found them to be accommodating to changes and modifications.

  desc: Structural Engineering is one of the most fascinating profession on our planet.
    It is a unique combination of art and science both. The main objective is to strike
    a balance between the two, but how we can achieve that? A very slim as well as
    a very bulky structure, both give us a mental discomfort. When it is too slim
    we have an uneasy feeling regarding its safety and when it is too bulky we get
    a jarring feeling. So the true magic of a structure lies in its proportioning.But
    how one can find the right way through the convoluted path of art and science?
    A small anecdote will perhaps give you the clue.
